â†“ Stickify Pusher
===================
 - **Pre-built executable is in the `dist` folder if you do not want to compile Stickify Pusher yourself.**  
	 - This executable connects to the *stickify.herokuapp.com* server. 
		 - Provided server is set to wipe nicknames and associated sticky notes if Sticky Pusher has not contacted the server in 24 hours. 
		 - [Stickify Server source](https://github.com/ansonl/stickify-server). 
	 - If you get an error about a missing DLL, your computer is missing the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for VS 2015. The patch can be downloaded [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145). Pyinstaller currently has an issue with bundling the required library in an executable [#1588](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/1588).
 - You may use the [Stickify web app](https://stickify.gq) to view sticky notes on your phone/other computer.
